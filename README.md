# VITON-DRR: Details Retention Virtual Try-on via Non-rigid Registration

## Introduction
This repo is a pytorch implementation of the virtual try-on paper **VITON-DRR**

## Installation
`ipdb == 0.13.13`  
`opencv-python == 4.7.0.72`   
`pillow == 9.4.0`  
`torch == 1.12.1`

## Data preparation
#### Dataset
**VITON Dataset** This dataset is presented in [VITON](https://github.com/xthan/VITON), containing 19,000 image pairs, each of which includes a front-view woman image and a top clothing image. After removing the invalid image pairs, it yields 16,253 pairs, further splitting into a training set of 14,221 pairs and a testing set of 2,032 pairs.

####  Data Pre-processing
###### 1. DensePose
Please check the [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects/DensePose) repository. Dense pose image obtained by running `apply_net.py`.

###### 2. Parse agnostic
You can get a parse agnostic image by the code `./segment/get_parse_agnostic.py`.





## Train the segment model
You can train the Human Semantics Generation Module with `./segment/train_condition.py`.

## test 

1. The reconstructed human semantic segmentation results are generated by running `./segment/test_condition.py`.
2. You can run `test.py` to generate virtual try-on results.  

## Checkpoint 
We used the pre-trained models `latest_net_G2.pth` from ACGPN, which can be download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UWT6esQIU_d4tUm8cjxDKMhB8joQbrFx/view?usp=sharing).  
You can download Human Semantics Generation Module checkpoint from [here] (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Ds8Rj6ioTFXppE5vkSLI8A?pwd=x67y)

## Results
Examples of virtual try-on results synthesized by our method. Given a reference human body image and a product clothing image, our method can synthesize a high-quality virtual try-on result while preserving garment details.
